\# 🏴‍☠️ Treasure Island Game



Welcome to \*\*Treasure Island\*\*, an interactive text-based adventure game built with Python. Your mission is to find the hidden treasure... if you can survive!



\## 📝 About the Project



This project is a Python application designed to demonstrate the logic of \*\*control flow\*\* and \*\*conditional statements\*\*. It utilizes nested `if-elif-else` structures to create a branching narrative where every choice the player makes determines the outcome of the game.



The program handles user input dynamically (case-insensitive) to ensure a smooth user experience.



\## 🎮 Gameplay



You are an adventurer looking for the legendary lost treasure. You will face a series of choices:



1\.  \*\*The Crossroad:\*\* Choose your path wisely (Left or Right).

2\.  \*\*The Lake:\*\* Decide how to reach the island (Swim or Wait).

3\.  \*\*The Doors:\*\* Pick the correct door to find the treasure (Red, Yellow, or Blue).



\*Be careful! Wrong choices will lead to a "Game Over" by wild beasts, supernatural forces, or traps.\*
